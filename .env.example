The error message indicates that there's a circular reference in your entities when the Shelter entity is converted to JSON for the response. This happens because the Shelter entity contains a reference to Staff entities, which in turn contain a reference back to the Shelter entity.

To resolve this, you need to avoid sending the circular references in your response. One way to achieve this is to use a DTO (Data Transfer Object) for your responses that excludes the circular references. Another way is to use a serialization library like class-transformer to handle the transformation properly.

Here's how you can implement a solution using DTOs:

bharta : id : 3
bhshelter : id : 4
